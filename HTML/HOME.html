                <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>José Pacheco is a fourth-generation baker born into the business owned & operated by his parents. Countless hours were spent in the bakery where his father, Roberto, a master baker, taught José everything about baking and running a business. They dreamed that together, they would make Pacheco’s Bakery a household name. In his 100,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art facility, José and his staff whip up thousands of wedding cakes, specialty cakes and delicious Mexican pastries. His award winning designs have been featured in countless bridal and baking magazines.</p>
